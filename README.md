# Accessibility Refactor

Fixed this website to meet accessibility standards.

## Getting Started

To view this web page follow the link in the [Deployed Link](#deployed-link) section.

### Prerequisites

To view this webpage you need a browser. Any browser will do. If you somehow don't already have a browser I'm not sure how you got to this README.

### Installing

This is a web page. There isn't much to it. I don't think this is the forum for explaining how to deploy a web page and the specifics will vary depending on your server set up.
